## Explorium MCP Server (Apify Actor)

Unlock the power of the **Explorium Business Data Hub** via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This Apify Actor provides AI clients with **real-time access to comprehensive company, contact, and market intelligence**‚Äîautomating data enrichment, company/person lookups, feature discovery, and web search capabilities from Explorium‚Äôs vast data universe. Use your Apify credits to run this server; no fine-tuning required. üìà

The Explorium MCP Server acts as a remote proxy, enabling clients like GitHub Copilot and other AI agents to enrich entities and discover predictive features from Explorium‚Äôs third‚Äëparty data ecosystem. It supports streamable HTTP transport for robust and efficient client usage.

**Key Capabilities:**
*   **Data Enrichment:** Enrich companies and people with detailed firmographics, technographics, professional, and contact attributes.
*   **Feature Discovery:** Generate model-ready features for machine learning and analytical use cases.
*   **Dynamic Querying:** Search and retrieve attributes for entities by various identifiers.
*   **Real-time Web Search:** Access live, up-to-date web searches from Perplexity Sonar API.

About this MCP Server: To understand how to connect to and utilize MCP servers, please refer to the official Model Context Protocol documentation at [mcp.apify.com](https://mcp.apify.com).

## Connection URL
MCP clients can connect to this server at:

```text
https://mcp-servers--explorium-mcp-server.apify.actor/mcp
```

## Client Configuration
To connect to this MCP server, use the following configuration in your MCP client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "explorium": {
      "url": "https://mcp-servers--explorium-mcp-server.apify.actor/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_APIFY_TOKEN"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Note: Replace `YOUR_APIFY_TOKEN` with your actual Apify API token (find it in the [Apify Console](https://console.apify.com/account/integrations)). Direct remote connections to Explorium‚Äôs public MCP endpoint (`https://mcp.explorium.ai/mcp`) typically use an OAuth-based authorization managed by the client (like `mcp-remote`) rather than a direct API key in headers. Your Apify Actor transparently handles this connection.

### Notes and Best Practices

*   **Authentication:** Accessing this Apify Actor requires your Apify API token. The Actor itself connects to the Explorium MCP via `mcp-remote`, which manages its own OAuth-based authorization with Explorium transparently. For direct Docker self-hosting of Explorium, an API key (`API_ACCESS_TOKEN`) would be required, but this is not applicable when using this Apify Actor.
*   **Rate Limits and Quotas:** Explorium APIs and your Actor may enforce rate limits. Implement backoff/retry where appropriate.
*   **Field Selection:** Use the fields parameter to minimize payloads and speed up responses.
*   **Compliance:** Ensure your usage of enriched attributes complies with your organization‚Äôs data governance and Explorium‚Äôs terms.
