## Browserbase MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI-powered web automation capabilities using Stagehand. This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages, perform actions, extract data, and observe possible actions in a real browser environment.

**About this MCP Server:** To understand how to connect to and utilize this MCP server, please refer to the official Model Context Protocol documentation at https://mcp.apify.com.

---

### Get Started

Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies, then run `npm run build` to get `dist/index.js`.

Set up your Claude Desktop configuration to use the server.

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stagehand": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/mcp-server-browserbase/stagehand/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "BROWSERBASE_API_KEY": "<YOUR_BROWSERBASE_API_KEY>",
        "BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID": "<YOUR_BROWSERBASE_PROJECT_ID>",
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>",
        "CONTEXT_ID": "<YOUR_CONTEXT_ID>"
      }
    }
  }
}

Or, for running locally, first open Chrome in debug mode like so:

open -a "Google Chrome" --args --remote-debugging-port=9222

{
  "mcpServers": {
    "stagehand": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["path/to/mcp-server-browserbase/stagehand/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAI_API_KEY": "<YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY>",
        "LOCAL_CDP_URL": "http://localhost:9222"
      }
    }
  }
}

ðŸ’¡ Check out our documentation for getting your local CDP URL!

Restart your Claude Desktop app and you should see the tools available by clicking the ðŸ”¨ icon.

Start using the tools! Below is a demo video of Claude doing a Google search for OpenAI using Stagehand MCP server and Browserbase for a remote headless browser.

### Tools

**Stagehand commands**

- stagehand_navigate  
  Navigate to any URL in the browser  
  Input:  
    - url (string): The URL to navigate to

- stagehand_act  
  Perform an action on the web page  
  Inputs:  
    - action (string): The action to perform (e.g., "click the login button")  
    - variables (object, optional): Variables used in the action template

- stagehand_extract

### Resources

The server provides access to one resource:

- Console Logs (console://logs)  
  - Browser console output in text format  
  - Includes all console messages from the browser

- Screenshots (screenshot://<n>)  
  - PNG images of captured screenshots  
  - Accessible via the screenshot name specified during capture

---

### File Structure

The codebase is organized into the following modules:

- index.ts: Entry point that initializes and runs the server.
- server.ts: Core server logic, including server creation, configuration, and request handling.
- tools.ts: Definitions and implementations of tools that can be called by MCP clients.
- prompts.ts: Prompt templates that can be used by MCP clients.
- resources.ts: Resource definitions and handlers for resource-related requests.
- logging.ts: Comprehensive logging system with rotation and formatting capabilities.
- utils.ts: Utility functions including JSON Schema to Zod schema conversion and message sanitization.
