```json
{
    "actor-start": {
        "eventTitle": "MCP server startup",
        "eventDescription": "Initial fee for starting the Actor MCP Server",
        "eventPriceUsd": 0.1
    },
    "tool-call": {
        "eventTitle": "MCP tool call",
        "eventDescription": "Fee for executing MCP tools",
        "eventPriceUsd": 0.05
    }
}
```

In the Actor, trigger events with:

```python
await Actor.charge('actor-start', 1)  # Charge for server startup
await Actor.charge('tool-call', 1)    # Charge for tool execution
```

To set up the PPE model:

1. Go to your Actor's **Publication settings**.
2. Set the **Pricing model** to `Pay per event`.
3. Add the pricing schema (see [pay_per_event.json](.actor/pay_per_event.json) for a complete example).

## ðŸ”§ How It Works

This template implements a proxy server that can connect to a stdio-based, Streamable HTTP, or SSE-based MCP server and expose it via [legacy Server-Sent Events (SSE) transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports#http-with-sse) or [Streamable HTTP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#streamable-http). Here's how it works:

### Server types

1. **Stdio Server** (`StdioServerParameters`):
    - Spawns a local process that implements the MCP protocol over stdio.
    - Configure using the `command` parameter to specify the executable and the `args` parameter for additional arguments.
    - Optionally, use the `env` parameter to pass environment variables to the process.

Example:

```python
server_type = ServerType.STDIO
MCP_SERVER_PARAMS = StdioServerParameters(
    command='uv',
    args=['run', 'osp_marketing_tools'],
    env={'YOUR_ENV_VAR': os.getenv('YOUR-ENV-VAR')},  # Optional environment variables
)
```

2. **Remote Server** (`RemoteServerParameters`):
    - Connects to a remote MCP server via HTTP or SSE transport.
    - Configure using the `url` parameter to specify the server's endpoint.
    - Set the appropriate `server_type` (ServerType.HTTP or ServerType.SSE).
    - Optionally, use the `headers` parameter to include custom headers (e.g., for authentication) and the `auth` parameter for additional authentication mechanisms.

Example:

```python
server_type = ServerType.HTTP
MCP_SERVER_PARAMS = RemoteServerParameters(
    url='https://mcp.apify.com',
    headers={'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR-API-KEY'},  # Replace with your authentication token
)
```

Note: SSE transport is also supported by setting `server_type = ServerType.SSE`.

- **Tips**:
    - Ensure the remote server supports the transport type you're using and is accessible from the Actor's environment.
    - Use environment variables to securely store sensitive information like tokens or API keys.

#### Environment variables:

Environment variables can be securely stored and managed at the Actor level on the [Apify platform](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/programming-interface/environment-variables#custom-environment-variables). These variables are automatically injected into the Actor's runtime environment, allowing you to:

- Keep sensitive information like API keys secure.
- Simplify configuration by avoiding hardcoded values in your code.

### Proxy implementation

The proxy server (`ProxyServer` class) handles:

- Creating a Starlette web server with legacy SSE (`/sse` and `/messages/`) and Streamable HTTP (`/mcp`) endpoints
- Managing connections to the underlying MCP server
- Forwarding requests and responses between clients and the MCP server
- Handling charging through the `actor_charge_function`

Key components:

- `ProxyServer`: Main class that manages the proxy functionality
- `create_proxy_server`: Creates an MCP server instance that proxies requests
- `charge_mcp_operation`: Handles charging for different MCP operations

### MCP operations

The proxy supports all standard MCP operations:

- `list_tools()`: List available tools
- `call_tool()`: Execute a tool with arguments
- `list_prompts()`: List available prompts
- `get_prompt()`: Get a specific prompt
- `list_resources()`: List available resources
- `read_resource()`: Read a specific resource

Each operation can be configured for charging in the PPE model.

## Getting started

For complete information [see this article](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development#build-actor-locally). To run the Actor use the following command:

```bash
apify run
```

## Deploy to Apify

### Connect Git repository to Apify

If you've created a Git repository for the project, you can easily connect to Apify:

1. Go to [Actor creation page](https://console.apify.com/actors/new)
2. Click on **Link Git Repository** button

### Push project on your local machine to Apify

You can also deploy the project on your local machine to Apify without the need for the Git repository.

1. Log in to Apify. You will need to provide your [Apify API Token](https://console.apify.com/account/integrations) to complete this action.

    ```bash
    apify login
    ```

2. Deploy your Actor. This command will deploy and build the Actor on the Apify Platform. You can find your newly created Actor under [Actors -> My Actors](https://console.apify.com/actors?tab=my).

    ```bash
    apify push
    ```
