## MCP server template

A template for running and monetizing a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server using [stdio](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#standard-input%2Foutput-stdio) transport on [Apify platform](https://docs.apify.com/platform).
This allows you to run any stdio MCP server as a [standby Actor](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/programming-interface/standby) and connect via either the [streamable HTTP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#streamable-http) with an [MCP client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients).

## How to use

Change the `MCP_COMMAND` to spawn your stdio MCP server in `src/main.ts`, and don't forget to install the required MCP server in the `package.json` (using `npm install ...`).
By default, this template runs an [Everything MCP Server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/everything) using the following command:

```
const MCP_COMMAND = [
    'npx',
    '@modelcontextprotocol/server-everything',
];
```

Alternatively, you can use the [`mcp-remote`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mcp-remote) tool to turn a remote MCP server into an Actor. For example, to connect to a remote server with authentication:

```
const MCP_COMMAND = [
    'npx',
    'mcp-remote',
    'https://mcp.apify.com',
    '--header',
    'Authorization: Bearer TOKEN',
];
```

Feel free to configure billing logic in `.actor/pay_per_event.json` and `src/billing.ts`.

[Push your Actor](https://docs.apify.com/academy/deploying-your-code/deploying) to the Apify platform, configure [standby mode](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/programming-interface/standby), and then connect to the Actor standby URL with your MCP client using the endpoint: `https://me--my-mcp-server.apify.actor/mcp` ([streamable HTTP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/basic/transports#streamable-http)).

**Important:** When connecting to your deployed MCP server, you must pass your Apify API token in the `Authorization` header as a Bearer token. For example:

```
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_APIFY_API_TOKEN>
```

This is required for authentication and to access your Actor endpoint.

### Pay per event

This template uses the [Pay Per Event (PPE)](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/publishing/monetize#pay-per-event-pricing-model) monetization model, which provides flexible pricing based on defined events.

To charge users, define events in JSON format and save them on the Apify platform. Here is an example schema with the `tool-request` event:

```json
[
    {
        "tool-request": {
            "eventTitle": "Price for completing a tool request",
            "eventDescription": "Flat fee for completing a tool request.",
            "eventPriceUsd": 0.05
        }
    }
]
```

In the Actor, trigger the event with:

```typescript
await Actor.charge({ eventName: 'tool-request' });
```

This approach allows you to programmatically charge users directly from your Actor, covering the costs of execution and related services.

To set up the PPE model for this Actor:

- **Configure Pay Per Event**: establish the Pay Per Event pricing schema in the Actor's **Monetization settings**. First, set the **Pricing model** to `Pay per event` and add the schema. An example schema can be found in [pay_per_event.json](.actor/pay_per_event.json).

## Getting started

For complete information [see this article](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development#build-actor-locally). To run the Actor use the following command:

```bash
apify run
```

## Deploy to Apify

### Connect Git repository to Apify

If you've created a Git repository for the project, you can easily connect to Apify:

1. Go to [Actor creation page](https://console.apify.com/actors/new)
2. Click on **Link Git Repository** button

### Push project on your local machine to Apify

You can also deploy the project on your local machine to Apify without the need for the Git repository.

1. Log in to Apify. You will need to provide your [Apify API Token](https://console.apify.com/account/integrations) to complete this action.

    ```bash
    apify login
    ```

2. Deploy your Actor. This command will deploy and build the Actor on the Apify Platform. You can find your newly created Actor under [Actors -> My Actors](https://console.apify.com/actors?tab=my).

    ```bash
    apify push
    ```
