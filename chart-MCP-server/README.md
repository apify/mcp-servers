## Chart MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol server for generating charts using [AntV](https://github.com/antvis/). We can use this mcp server for _chart generation_ and _data analysis_.

**About this MCP Server:** To understand how to connect to and utilize this MCP server, please refer to the official Model Context Protocol documentation at [mcp.apify.com](<https://mcp.apif>

This is a TypeScript-based MCP server that provides chart generation capabilities. It allows you to create various types of charts through MCP tools. You can also use it in [Dify](https://marketplace.dify.ai/plugins/antv/visualization).

## âœ¨ Features

Now 25+ charts supported.

1. `generate_scatter_chart`: Generate a `scatter` plot, used to display the relationship between two variables, showing data points as scattered dots on a coordinate system.
1. `generate_treemap_chart`: Generate a `treemap`, used to display hierarchical data, showing data in rectangular forms where the size of rectangles represents the value of the data.
1. `generate_venn_chart`: Generate a `venn` diagram, used to display relationships between sets, including intersections, unions, and differences.
1. `generate_violin_chart`: Generate a `violin` plot, used to display the distribution of data, combining features of boxplots and density plots to provide a more detailed view of the data distribution.
1. `generate_word_cloud_chart`: Generate a `word-cloud`, used to display the frequency of words in textual data, with font sizes indicating the frequency of each word.
