## Exa MCP Server

HTTP MCP proxy to Exa's hosted MCP server at https://mcp.exa.ai/mcp. This Actor exposes a streamable HTTP endpoint so MCP clients can connect using an Apify-hosted URL with Bearer auth.

## How to use

This server uses mcp-remote to connect to Exa and supports optional EXA_API_KEY (appended to the URL as exaApiKey).

## Connection URL

MCP clients can connect to this server at:

https://mcp-servers--exa-mcp-server.apify.actor/mcp

## Client Configuration

Use this configuration in your MCP client (replace your-apify-token with your token from Apify Console):

{
    "mcpServers": {
        "exa": {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "https://mcp-servers--exa-mcp-server.apify.actor/mcp",
            "headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_APIFY_TOKEN"
            }
        }
    }
}

Optionally set EXA_API_KEY as an Actor environment variable to use your Exa key.

### Pay per event

This Actor uses the [Pay Per Event (PPE)](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/publishing/monetize#pay-per-event-pricing-model) model. Exa tool calls map to events defined in [.actor/pay_per_event.json](.actor/pay_per_event.json) such as `exa-get-code-context`, `exa-web-search`, etc. Unknown tools fall back to `tool-request`.

To charge users, define events in JSON format and save them on the Apify platform. Here is an example schema with the `tool-request` event:

Event charging is performed in `src/billing.ts` based on the MCP method and tool name.

To set up the PPE model: in Actor Monetization settings, choose Pay per event and paste the content of [.actor/pay_per_event.json](.actor/pay_per_event.json).
