# AntV Chart MCP Server Actorization Checklist

## üöÅ MCP server selection
- [x] Choose an interesting MCP server from registry - Selected AntV Chart MCP Server
- [x] Make sure the open-source server is working - Verified from GitHub repo
- [x] Make sure no other developer is already working on the selected server - Confirmed
- [x] Add or update the entry in Actorization MCP servers - N/A for this task
- [ ] Obtain API key(s) if payment necessary - No API keys needed for basic chart generation

## ‚å®Ô∏è Start coding
- [x] Check whether the mcp-servers repository is available locally using git status
- [x] Navigate to the mcp-servers directory
- [x] Check if the feat/antvis-chart-mcp-server branch exists locally and create it

## üë∑ Programming language
- [x] Examine the source repository to determine if it is Python or TypeScript based code - **TypeScript**
- [x] Determine if it is stdio-based or remote server - **stdio-based with remote capabilities**
- [x] Clone repository in the current working directory with name antvis-chart-mcp-server-tmp
- [x] Select a template - **TypeScript template** (ts-mcp-server)
- [x] Actor name: AntV Chart MCP Server
- [x] Initialize the Actor using Apify-CLI
- [x] Navigate to the subdirectory
- [x] Create this checklist file

## ‚å®Ô∏è Stdio-based vs remote server
### 1. Stdio-based
- [x] Install the MCP server and its dependencies - `npm install @antv/mcp-server-chart`
- [x] Remove any unused packages from the template - Removed @modelcontextprotocol/server-everything
- [x] Configure the run command - Updated MCP_COMMAND to use @antv/mcp-server-chart
- [x] Refer to the source repository's README to find the recommended start command
- [x] Edit the run command in main script (src/main.ts)

## üìÉ Actor README file
- [ ] AntV Chart MCP Server as a title
- [ ] Short description
- [ ] URL that MCP clients can use for connecting
- [ ] Link to the mcp-servers git repo
- [ ] Link to Apify MCP docs
- [ ] Claim contact info
- [ ] Add the Apify badge
- [ ] Add the Apify badge and entry into README.md at mcp-servers root
- [ ] The actual server README (from git README)
- [ ] Update Actor description in .actor/actor.json

## üí∞ Add pricing information into the code
- [ ] Check the source server tools (25+ chart generation tools identified)
- [ ] Modify src/billing.ts to match the source server tools
- [ ] Update .actor/pay_per_event.json with estimated prices for each event
- [ ] Rename tools to match the actual server tools
- [ ] Make event names descriptive and match the actual functionality being charged

## üß™ Test the server locally
- [ ] Set up required environment variables (if any)
- [ ] Run: APIFY_META_ORIGIN='STANDBY' ACTOR_WEB_SERVER_PORT=3002 apify run -p
- [ ] Connect to the server using MCP inspector
- [ ] Test chart generation functionality

## üß™ Test the server at Apify
- [ ] Deploy to personal Apify account first: apify login && apify push
- [ ] Set up ENV variables in the console
- [ ] Test the deployed server

## üí™ Push to GitHub repository
- [ ] Create a PR to https://github.com/apify/mcp-servers
- [ ] Ask for a code review
