## ‚ùå The Problem: Expired Knowledge

- Out of date code examples & stale data from year-old model training
- Hallucinated syntax & APIs
- Old or mismatched versions

## ‚úÖ The Solution: @latest docs at warp speed

- Always in sync with the latest version of docs
- Accurate descriptions and code examples
- Sub-second retrieval results (500ms @ p95) in your AI code editor

Docfork MCP pulls @latest documentation and code examples straight from the source - and adds them right into your context.

Just tell Cursor to **`use docfork`**:

```txt
Create a basic Next.js app with the App Router. use docfork
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Available Tools

Docfork MCP provides the following tool that LLMs can use:

- `get-library-docs`: Searches the library and returns its documentation.
  - `libraryName` (required): The name of the library to search for
  - `topic` (required): Focus the docs on a specific topic (e.g., "routing", "hooks")
  - `tokens` (optional, default 10000, max 50000): Max number of tokens to return. Values less than the configured `DEFAULT_MINIMUM_TOKENS` value or the default value of 10000 are automatically increased to that value.

## üí° Tips

### Add a Rule

If you don't want to add `use docfork` to every prompt, you can define a simple rule from your `Cursor Settings > Rules` section in Cursor (or the equivalent in your MCP client) to auto-invoke Docfork on any code question:

```markdown
---
alwaysApply: true
---

when the user requests code examples, setup or configuration steps, or library/API documentation
use docfork.
```

From then on you'll get Docfork's docs in any related conversation without typing anything extra. You can add your use cases to the match part.

### Use Specific Library Names

When you know exactly which library you want to use, be specific in your prompts. This helps Docfork find the right documentation faster and more accurately:

```txt
implement basic authentication with supabase. use docfork
```

```txt
create a Next.js middleware for rate limiting. use docfork
```

```txt
configure Tailwind CSS with custom typography. use docfork
```

The more specific you are about the library and what you want to accomplish, the better documentation you'll receive.
