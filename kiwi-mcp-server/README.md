## About this MCP Server

The [Kiwi.com](https://kiwi.com) MCP server allow you to search and book for flights using the Kiwi.com flights search engine.

The MCP server exposes a single tool: search-flight. This allows you to get instant access to a curated list of the best flights for your trip based on:

1.  Round-trip or one-way flight
2.  Origin / destination (city or airport)
3.  Travel dates
4.  Flexibility up to +/- 3 days
5.  Number and types of passengers (adult, child, infant)
6.  Cabin class (economy, premium economy, business, first class)

Simply ask your AI assistant something like:

*   "Can you help me book a first-class ticket from Paris to Rome tomorrow?"
*   "Find me the best options for our family vacation. I need a round-trip flight for my husband, me and our two children from Vienna to London, August 3 to 10."

You can also narrow your query by choosing your preferred airport, or enlarge it by specifying that your dates are flexible. Each result includes a booking link directly to the flight chosen.
