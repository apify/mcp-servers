### Pay per event

This template uses the [Pay Per Event (PPE)](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/publishing/monetize#pay-per-event-pricing-model) monetization model, which provides flexible pricing based on defined events.

To charge users, define events in JSON format and save them on the Apify platform. Here is an example schema with the `tool-request` event:

```json
[
    {
        "tool-request": {
            "eventTitle": "Price for completing a tool request",
            "eventDescription": "Flat fee for completing a tool request.",
            "eventPriceUsd": 0.05
        }
    }
]
```

In the Actor, trigger the event with:

```typescript
await Actor.charge({ eventName: 'tool-request' });
```

This approach allows you to programmatically charge users directly from your Actor, covering the costs of execution and related services.

To set up the PPE model for this Actor:

- **Configure Pay Per Event**: establish the Pay Per Event pricing schema in the Actor's **Monetization settings**. First, set the **Pricing model** to `Pay per event` and add the schema. An example schema can be found in [pay_per_event.json](.actor/pay_per_event.json).
