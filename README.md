# MCP Servers Monorepo

A comprehensive collection of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers published at Apify, providing managed wrappers around existing MCP servers for enhanced functionality, reliability, and ease of use.

## 🚀 Overview

This monorepo contains a variety of MCP servers that extend the capabilities of AI applications by providing secure, controlled access to external tools and data sources. Each server is designed to be production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and monitoring.

**Important:** These are **wrappers** around existing open-source MCP servers. We do not claim ownership of the original MCP server implementations. All credits go to the original developers.

### Claim this MCP server

🚩 **Claim this MCP server** – If you are the original developer and would like to claim ownership or have any concerns, please write to [ai@apify.com](mailto:ai@apify.com).

## 🛠️ Quick start

### Prerequisites

- **For TypeScript servers**: Node.js 18+ and npm
- **For Python servers**: Python 3.8+ and pip
- **For all servers**: Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### Installation

Each server can be installed and run independently:

```bash
# TypeScript servers
cd <server-name>
npm install
npm start

# Python servers
cd <server-name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.main
```

### Using with MCP clients

Configure your MCP client (like Claude Desktop) to use these servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "brave-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@apify/brave-search-mcp-server"]
    },
    "calculator": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "src.main"],
      "cwd": "./calculator-MCP-server"
    }
  }
}
```
## 🔧 Development

### Templates

When creating new MCP servers, you can use our pre-built templates:
