### 🚀 Getting Started

#### 📋 Requirements

* **Lara Translate API Credentials** (refer to the [Official Documentation](https://developers.laratranslate.com/))
* An **LLM client that supports Model Context Protocol (MCP)**, such as Claude Desktop, Cursors, or GitHub Copilot
* **NPX or Docker** (depending on your preferred installation method)

#### 🔌 Installation

**Introduction**

The installation process is standardized across all MCP clients. It involves manually adding a configuration object to your client's MCP configuration JSON file. If you're unsure how to configure an MCP with your client, please refer to your MCP client's official documentation. Lara Translate MCP supports multiple installation methods, including NPX and Docker. Below, we'll use NPX as an example.

**Installation & Configuration**

1.  **Step 1:** Open your client's MCP configuration JSON file with a text editor, then copy and paste the following snippet:

    ```json
    {
      "mcpServers": {
        "lara-translate": {
          "command": "npx",
          "args": [
            "-y",
            "@translated/lara-mcp@latest"
          ],
          "env": {
            "LARA_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>",
            "LARA_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET": "<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET>"
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

2.  **Step 2:** Replace `<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID>` and `<YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET>` with your Lara Translate API credentials (refer to the [Official Documentation](https://developers.laratranslate.com/) for details).
3.  **Step 3:** **Restart your MCP client.**

**Verify Installation**

After restarting your MCP client, you should see Lara Translate MCP in the list of available MCPs. The method for viewing installed MCPs varies by client. Please consult your MCP client's documentation. To verify that Lara Translate MCP is working correctly, try translating with a simple prompt:

`Translate with Lara "Hello world" to Spanish`

Your MCP client will begin generating a response. If Lara Translate MCP is properly installed and configured, your client will either request approval for the action or display a notification that Lara Translate is being used.

          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```
