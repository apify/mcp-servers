### Development of SlideSpeak MCP

The following information is related to development of the SlideSpeak MCP. These steps are not needed to use the MCP.

#### Building the Docker Image

This is for local testing, if you want to publish a new docker container check out the "Making a new version" section below.

```bash
docker build . -t slidespeak/slidespeak-mcp:TAG-HERE
```

#### Development

**Install uv**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Create virtual environment and activate it**

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Install dependencies**

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Using the server directly without Docker

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "slidespeak": {
      "command": "/path/to/.local/bin/uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "/path/to/slidespeak-mcp",
        "run",
        "slidespeak.py"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SLIDESPEAK_API_KEY": "API-KEY-HERE"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Making a new release

Version naming should be in the format of `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `1.0.0`).  
The version needs to be updated in the following files:

- `pyproject.toml` â†’ `version`  
- `slidespeak.py` â†’ `USER_AGENT`

Make a new release in GitHub and tag it with the version number. This will trigger a GitHub Action. The release will be automatically built and pushed to Docker Hub.
